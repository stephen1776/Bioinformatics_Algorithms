# Bioinformatics Algorithms 
This is my collection of Python codes that I wrote in solving the series of "code challenges" from the awesome textbook:[Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner.\\
I was able to check my codes on the Rosalind Bioinformatics website.  
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track "Rosalind") is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
