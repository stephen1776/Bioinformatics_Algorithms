# Bioinformatics_Algorithms
This is my collection of Python codes that I wrote to implement the algorithms found on the Rosalind Bioinformatics website.  
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track "Rosalind") is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
