# Bioinformatics Algorithms
## Description ##
This is my collection of Python codes that I wrote to solve the series of "code challenges" from the textbook [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner.
I checked my codes on the [Rosalind Bioinformatics website](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track "Rosalind").
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) 'is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.'
